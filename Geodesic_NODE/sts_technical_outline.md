## Section 1: The Spectral Interpolation Challenge

### 1.1 The Concrete Problem
- **Setup**: UV-visible spectroscopy for arsenic detection in drinking water
- **Available data**: Spectra at 6 concentrations (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60 ppb) across 601 wavelengths
- **Task**: Predict spectrum at any intermediate concentration (e.g., 45 ppb)
- **Stakes**: WHO limit is 10 ppb; accurate detection saves lives

### 1.2 The Catastrophic Failure of Linear Interpolation
- **Example**: At wavelength λ = 459 nm
  - Absorbance at 40 ppb: A₄₀ = 0.08
  - Absorbance at 60 ppb: A₆₀ = 0.06  
  - Linear prediction at 50 ppb: A₅₀ᴸⁱⁿ = 0.07
  - Actual value at 50 ppb: A₅₀ = 0.12
  - Error: >70%
- **Root cause**: Non-monotonic response - absorbance increases then decreases
- **Implication**: No linear combination of endpoints can capture the intermediate peak

### 1.3 Why This Problem is Fundamentally Hard
- **Non-monotonicity**: At many wavelengths, absorbance vs concentration curves loop back
- **Wavelength diversity**: Each wavelength has different non-monotonic patterns
- **Sparse data**: Only 6 points to learn complex relationships
- **High dimensionality**: 601 wavelengths create 601 interpolation problems

### 1.4 The Key Insight
- **Realization**: The problem isn't finding values "between" endpoints
- **New perspective**: Find smooth paths through spectral space
- **Core idea**: Learn what makes transitions easy or hard, then find optimal paths

## Section 2: The Geometric Framework

### 2.1 From Interpolation to Geometry
- **Traditional view**: Interpolate concentration values directly
- **Geometric view**: Navigate through spectral space along optimal paths
- **Analogy**: Like finding shortest path on Earth's surface - not straight through Earth

### 2.2 Why Differential Geometry is Necessary
- **Euclidean assumption**: Straight lines are optimal paths
- **Reality check**: When responses are non-monotonic, straight lines fail
- **Geometric solution**: Learn a metric where "distance" reflects spectral similarity
- **Result**: Curved paths (geodesics) that naturally handle non-monotonicity

### 2.3 The Metric Tensor: Quantifying Spectral Volatility
- **Definition**: g(c,λ) measures how rapidly spectra change at each point
- **Physical meaning**:
  - High g(c,λ): Small concentration change → large spectral change
  - Low g(c,λ): Stable region with predictable changes
- **Learning task**: Neural network learns g from data

### 2.4 Geodesics: Optimal Paths Through Learned Geometry
- **Mathematical definition**: Paths that minimize ∫√(g(c,λ))|dc/dt|dt
- **Physical interpretation**: Paths that avoid volatile regions when possible
- **Key property**: Naturally curve to follow spectral evolution

## Section 3: Technical Architecture and Design Decisions

### 3.1 Why 1D Manifolds per Wavelength (Not 2D)
- **Option considered**: Single 2D manifold over (concentration, wavelength)
- **Our choice**: 601 independent 1D manifolds, one per wavelength
- **Justification**:
  1. **Dense wavelength sampling**: 1 nm increments make wavelength interpolation unnecessary
  2. **Distinct chemistry**: Each wavelength has unique absorption mechanisms
  3. **Computational tractability**: 1D geodesics are second-order ODEs; 2D requires PDEs
  4. **Natural parallelization**: 601 independent problems map perfectly to GPU

### 3.2 Why One Neural Network (Not 600)
- **Naive approach**: Train separate interpolation model per wavelength
- **Fatal flaw**: Each model sees only 6 data points → guaranteed overfitting
- **Our solution**: Single network g(c,λ) with wavelength as input
- **Benefits**:
  1. **Data efficiency**: Uses all 3,606 points for training
  2. **Shared chemistry**: Captures patterns common across wavelengths
  3. **Implicit regularization**: Parameter sharing prevents overfitting
  4. **Generalization**: Can predict at wavelengths not in training set

### 3.3 The Coupled ODE System Innovation
- **Challenge**: Need both path and spectral values along path
- **Solution**: Couple geodesic equation with spectral evolution
- **System**:
  ```
  dc/dt = v                           (position evolution)
  dv/dt = -Γ(c,λ)v²                  (geodesic acceleration)
  dA/dt = F(c,v,λ)                   (spectral evolution)
  ```
- **Key insight**: Velocity v indicates chemical transitions
- **Result**: Accurate absorbance prediction along entire path

### 3.4 Network Architecture Details
- **Metric Network g(c,λ)**:
  - Input: [concentration, wavelength] (normalized)
  - Architecture: 2 → 128 → 256 → 1
  - Activation: Tanh (smooth gradients)
  - Output: softplus(x) + 0.1 (ensures positivity)
  - Parameters: ~33K

- **Spectral Flow Network F(c,v,λ)**:
  - Input: [concentration, velocity, wavelength]
  - Architecture: 3 → 64 → 128 → 1
  - Activation: Tanh
  - Output: Linear (can be positive or negative)
  - Parameters: ~8.7K

  - Network evaluations per step: 3 (for Christoffel symbols)
- **Sequential computation**: Would take days

### 4.2 The Pre-computation Breakthrough
- **Bottleneck identified**: Computing Γ = ½g⁻¹(∂g/∂c)
- **Solution**: Pre-compute on 2000×601 grid
- **Implementation**:
  1. Evaluate g at grid points (one-time cost: ~30 seconds)
  2. Compute finite differences for derivatives
  3. Store Christoffel symbols in memory
  4. Use bilinear interpolation during integration

  - Coalesced memory access patterns
  - Tensor Core utilization for matrix operations
- **Memory optimization**:

  - Adjoint method avoids storing full trajectories
  - Pre-allocated workspace tensors

### 4.4 The Shooting Method for Boundary Value Problems
- **Problem**: Find initial velocity v₀ such that geodesic from c_start reaches c_end
- **Solution**: Iterative refinement
  ```
  1. Initial guess: v₀ = c_end - c_start (linear)
  2. Integrate geodesic with current v₀
  3. Compute error: ε = |c_final - c_target|
  4. Update: v₀ ← v₀ - α·ε
  5. Repeat until convergence
  ```
- **Parallelization**: All 18,030 shooting problems solved simultaneously
