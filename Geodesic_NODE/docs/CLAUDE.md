# Arsenic Detection System - Project Context

## Project Vision
A field-deployable arsenic detection system for underdeveloped regions where arsenic contamination in drinking water poses serious health risks. The system enables villagers and field workers to test water samples using low-cost colorimetric sensors and smartphone technology.

## User Workflow
1. Add water sample to low-cost test kit
2. Observe color change (red → blue transition)
3. Capture color with phone app
4. Receive arsenic concentration estimate
5. Upload GPS-tagged result to contamination hotspot map

## Technical Implementation

### Step 1: Sensor Design
- **Technology**: Methylene blue-functionalized gold nanoparticle assay
- **Detection Range**: 10-50 ppb As(V)3
- **Response**: Visible red-to-blue color change
- **Advantages**: Simple, low-cost, uses commercial nanoparticles, field-deployable

### Step 2: Spectral Interpolation
- **Challenge**: Non-monotonic color response (gray → blue → gray) creates ambiguity
- **Solution**: UV-Vis spectroscopy (200-800 nm) captures detailed absorbance fingerprints
- **ML Approach**: Train model on ⟨concentration, wavelength⟩ → absorbance mapping
- **Output**: Continuous concentration-color gradient for reliable estimates from photos

### Step 3: Hotspot Localization
- **Goal**: Efficient arsenic hotspot identification in water bodies
- **Method**: Adaptive sensor placement using Jacobian-based framework
- **Strategy**: Prioritize steep gradients and high uncertainty areas
- **Benefit**: High-resolution mapping with fewer samples than traditional uniform grids

## End-to-End Objectives
- Enable scalable, low-cost monitoring networks in resource-limited settings
- Empower communities to measure their own exposure
- Contribute to regional hotspot identification
- Eliminate dependency on expensive lab infrastructure

## Key Technical Considerations
- Color response interpretation must handle non-monotonic transitions
- Phone app needs robust color calibration across different devices/lighting
- GPS integration for spatial contamination mapping
- Data aggregation for community-level insights
- Low computational requirements for field deployment

## Development Priorities
1. Robust spectral interpolation model for concentration estimation
2. Phone app with accurate color capture and analysis
3. Cloud-based data aggregation and visualization
4. Adaptive sampling algorithms for efficient hotspot detection
5. User-friendly interface for non-technical users

## Success Metrics
- Detection accuracy within ±5 ppb in target range
- < $1 per test cost
- Results available within 5 minutes
- Functional on basic smartphones
- Reliable in varied field conditions (lighting, temperature)
